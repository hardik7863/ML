# instance based learning data dont see the pattern instead it will see surronding 
# behaviour see the white circle majority is passed then
# test  will pass otherwise fail
# it will learning religiously  from the training data
# based on the training data it will answer gives the output
# it memorises the data

# in model based learning , it uses generalised method 
# it creates a generalise model in which we draw decision boundary 
# above the decission boundary it is pass and below it is fail
# it learns from the data and form generalise pattern
